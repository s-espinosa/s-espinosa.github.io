I'm in the midst of studying at the [Turing School for Software & Design](http://www.turing.io), trying to pick up the skills I'll need to be a web developer. I took the plunge, moved from Brooklyln (see above), to Denver (photo coming soon), and have been, thus far, enjoying it thoroughly.

This is my home on the internet, and I'm remodeling. I expect to have more content up shortly, but to get an idea of the work that I've been doing please take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/s-espinosa) account, and feel free to get in touch with me at [sespinos@gmail.com](mailto:sespinos@gmail.com).
