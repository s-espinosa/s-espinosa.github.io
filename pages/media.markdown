### Turing Podcast

[Brennan Holtzclaw](https://github.com/brennanholtzclaw) let me come on the Turing podcast to share my ideas on what makes a technical podcast work. Actually, he tricked me. He tricked me into being on his podcast. I went to a student led session with some other students, and next thing we knew the microphone was out and we were recording. When it was all said and done, I think we all had a great time. I only hope we were able to give him some ideas to work with going forward.
