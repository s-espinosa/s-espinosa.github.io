      <h2>Towards an Agile User Experience</h2>

      <p>I would totally link you to Jeremy Fish’s Twitter profile, except for everyone on the internet hates him and he deleted his twitter account. For some background, Fish was one of the subjects of the documentary Indie Game, which showed him creating the game Fez. It’s a beautiful game. It looks like it was a pain to develop. It was a tortured process, and watching Fish move through it was pretty incredible. That said, his reputation on the internet is as one of kind of a jerk and/or baby. The video below will give you some idea of why.</p>

<p>If you didn’t bother to watch the movie, Fish basically talks about why he doesn’t like Japanese video games these days. He gets some help, and one of the other members of the panel talks about the difference between this:</p>

<p>OLD ZELDA IMAGE</p>

<p>and this:</p>

<p>NEW ZELDA IMAGE</p>

<p>Which is fine as far as it goes. When people are playing video games it makes sense that you might not want to have all the answers given to you. You might be looking for a challenge. You might enjoy banging your head on a wall. The new iterations of some video games give a lot more clues as to what comes next, and they probably don’t scratch that itch.</p>

<p>But I watched this video and it made me think of a different problem: instructions. The new Zelda games have perfected how to give a user instructions. All those things of the things that Fish and Co. hate about those new Zelda games have been iterated to make sure that people actually get the point, and know how to get to the next level/challenge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, web applications tend to either leave out instructions or have instructions that look like this:</p>

<p>NOT GOOD INSTRUCTIONS IMAGE</p>

<p>So what am I getting at? What can we learn from video games as we start to think about how to provide instructions to our users? I have three main takeaways.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Let users level up.</strong> The first and most important thing that I think video games have to offer is that they offer users value immediately, teach them things, and then also let them see more of the game over time. They have a way of introducing you to features just as you’re getting to the point that you’re ready for them. If you’re in the midst of designing something ask yourself, “is there a minimum use case for our users? What’s the absolute minimum that someone could use and actually find valuable?”</li>
  <li><strong>Provide inline instructions.</strong> When’s the last time you opened a video game with a manual? They’ve gone the way of the dinosaur. Don’t ask your users to completely break out of your application to view instructions or tutorials. Offer them hints and tips as they use it, when they’re ready. One app that does a wonderful job of doing this is the TraktorDJ iPhone app.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Don’t bother your users.</strong> On the other hand, there’s a limit. Navi in the new Zelda games serves as a navigator who’s constantly reminding you if you’re going the wrong way. She chirps at you (“Hey! Listen!”), and flies around to try to remind you of the task at hand. That’s fine, but it kind of reminds me of the Microsoft paperclip.</li>
</ol>

<p>This guy was just always getting in the way. Here’s another look at the Traktor iPhone app.</p>

<p>Now, that little button up in the left hand corner bothers me. It makes me want to learn more. It’s very much like a video game level that’s taunting me with the fact that I haven’t yet finished it. On the other hand, that’s something that I blame almost entirely on my own neuroses, and not at all on the application. Whether or not that’s fair is neither here nor there. I’m not annoyed at the app for trying to help me learn more about how to use it.</p>
