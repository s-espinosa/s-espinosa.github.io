Emax uses a combination of project management and communication tools to ensure the solicitation reflects the client priorities and is clearly written to facilitate the review and evaluation of proposals and developer selection.</p>

<h2>Proposal Evaluation and Selection</h2>

<p>Emax can help its clients with the proposal evaluation and contractor selection process, and has experience managing this process  for a variety of agencies.   Emax professionals have an effective approach to review proposals for compliance with all requirements, notify responders of non-compliance, analyze the proposals to determine how requirements are met, and prepare detailed summaries for the client’s solicitation review team and high level presentations to brief senior management to obtain approvals as necessary.   Emax can also provide comprehensive support during a protest but works proactively with the client to create an objective, well-documented proposal evaluation and selection process to minimize protests.</p>

<h2>Negotiation</h2>

<p>Public sector clients are often at a disadvantage when negotiating with the private sector.  Emax supports its clients in direct negotiations with private sector partners by providing pertinent information on financing trends, market information, and industry protocols.  Emax can participate in negotiations or advise effectively from behind the scenes.</p>

<h2>Program Monitoring and Oversight</h2>

<p>Program management and oversight are often overlooked until an issue or concern is raised.  Emax has extensive experience developing and implementing protocols to efficiently and effectively monitor new and ongoing programs.  Our expertise in the capital markets and real estate, and deep understanding of the unique constraints government agencies work within allow us to customize the monitoring and oversight program for each client.</p>

<h2>Real Estate Portfolio Management</h2>

<p>Emax advises clients on strategically managing their real estate portfolios to leverage property or land that is not being used or is under-utilized to generate additional revenue and/or reduce expenses.   Federal, state, and local governments are facing tough budget decisions, and want to use innovative ways to reduce expenses and create revenue. Emax helps clients determine the most appropriate asset disposition or leasing strategy to meet financial and portfolio management objectives by identifying a range of options and assessing the financial impact of each option. We also help clients identify land and/or buildings for acquisition by conducting due diligence, providing market information and presenting a range of financing options.</p>

<h2>Enhanced Use Lease (EUL)</h2>

<p>Operating an Enhanced Use Lease Program requires deep expertise in residential and commercial real estate, capital markets and program regulations.  Emax can assist with project feasibility, developer selection, transaction execution and closing, post-closing monitoring and program operation.  Emax has developed a number of tools to help the client negotiate fair “consideration” for projects and to ensure EUL lessees were providing “consideration” as agreed.  Emax also has reviewed and documented an EUL program from initial project selection through post-transaction monitoring and recommended changes to streamline approvals and enhance compliance. We have worked on a wide variety of EUL projects including affordable housing projects, energy co-generation plants, homeless shelters, office buildings, parking garages, golf courses, and daycare facilities.</p>

<h2>Military Housing Privatization Initiative</h2>

Emax has cutting-edge expertise in real estate finance, energy, marketing and legal and extensive experience advising clients throughout the MHPI process from project concept development through transaction closing.  To help achieve consensus around the development concept and the financial structure, Emax can facilitate a series of working sessions and analyze different financial scenarios based on varying project requirements, construction phasing, and financing terms to evaluate the budgetary impact of the various financial structures. After finalization of the project concept and financial structure, Emax develops the solicitation in coordination with the agency, conducts outreach to developers and lenders, and manages the solicitation review and developer selection process.  Emax can provide support throughout the transaction closing, and assist with negotiation, review of business operational plans and transaction document review.</p>

<h2>Real Estate Development and Financing</h2>

<p>To achieve a viable and successful real estate transaction, design, construction, finance and policy must be considered and navigated. Privatization poses particularly difficult challenges that require specialized knowledge in federal, environmental and energy regulations, management of government assets, and private sector negotiations.   On behalf of a client, Emax analyzes the transaction to determine if it is financially viable and can qualify for competitive financing from a lender or the bond markets under its current project and financial structure or if it needs to be adjusted.</p>

<p>Emax draws on its experience to generate new ideas that will allow projects to obtain financing and to move forward during these turbulent times. Our seasoned professionals bring creative solutions for a complex time.  Emax has historically been an active participant in the principal investment in real estate and debt secured by real estate.  Emax professionals have assisted clients in raising equity and debt in the acquisition of real estate backed debt and the underlying real estate. Emax can conduct due diligence for clients. As part of our development and planning practice, Emax manages the engagement of third party vendors to provide appraisals, broker price opinions, title reports, and environmental assessments for commercial and residential properties.</p>

<p>Market foresight is another skill vital to achieving lasting real estate solutions. Emax knows the complications that can negatively affect  a project, and this knowledge has enabled us to assist the government in complicated transactions brokered during a tumultuous economy with quick, creative solutions.
