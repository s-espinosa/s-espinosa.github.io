*I'm new here.*
I'm currently a student at the [Turing School of Software &amp Design](https://www.turing.io). Previously, I worked for three years as a middle school teacher, and after that for nine years as a consultant to various Federal agencies.
I'm in the midst of building a solid foundation in Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'll be looking for my next gig shortly. In the meantime, please feel free to [email me](mailto:sespinos@gmail.com).
